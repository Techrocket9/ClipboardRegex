# ClipboardRegex
A Windows utility to apply Regex replaces to strings copied onto the clipboard

This utility lets you do two-input field regex-replacement on every string copied to the clipboard a-la-notepad++.

Instead of operating on a document however, it runs the replacement on the contents of the clipboard whenever you copy (or cut) something.

The intent of this is to make the mindless task of copying strings from one source to another with small repetitive adjustmensts somewhat less awful.

It's minimally funcional now. I may add features/document/clean up code later.

Known compatibility issues with Ditto clipboard manager.
